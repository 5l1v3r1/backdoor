backdoor
========

Backdoor.js is a micro helper for a simple and helpful [JavaScript debugging technique](http://dm.gl/2014/11/14/JavaScript-backdoor-debugging/). Create a backdoor in some function scope and later access objects available in the scope or its parent scopes.

```
$ npm install backdoor
```
You can install it via npm or just paste backdoor.js source code somewhere before using it in your node app or a web page.
